## Motivation

Every Solidity extenstion on Visual Studio Code's Marketplacce contain multiple plugins. This can lead
to an inconssistent developer environment, or worse create conflicting configurations that, under the 
pretense of `helping` you, do things in the background to your files wihtout your explicit knowledge. 

Hence why this extenstion exists: only to provide syntax highlighting so that you can decided what to add without
having to give up basic functionality.

## Features

- Solidity Syntax Highlight
- No other plugins, configurations, etc: just syntax highlighting

- Support ^0.5.0 to <0.9.0

- see the additional `.vscode/settings` for better git workspace environment

- [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ContractShark.solidity-lang)

			   
## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `solidity-lang.enable`: enable/disable this extension


## Development

## What's in the folder

* This folder contains all of the files necessary for your extension.
* `package.json` - this is the manifest file in which you declare your language support and define the location of the grammar file that has been copied into your extension.
* `syntaxes/solidity.tmLanguage.json` - this is the Text mate grammar file that is used for tokenization.
* `language-configuration.json` - this is the language configuration, defining the tokens that are used for comments and brackets.
