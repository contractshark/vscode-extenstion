[![solidity - <0.9.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/solidity-v0.9.0-2ea44f?logo=solidity)](https://github.com/manifoldfinance)

## Motivation

Every Solidity extension on Visual Studio Code's Marketplace contain multiple plugins. This can
lead to an inconsistent developer environment, or worse create conflicting configurations that,
under the pretense of `helping` you, do things in the background to your files without your explicit
knowledge.

Hence why this extension exists: only to provide syntax highlighting so that you can decided what
to add without having to give up basic functionality.

## Features

- Solidity Syntax Highlighting

- Semantic Syntax Support

- Remote Container / Container support

- NatSpec Supported Highlighting

- Support ^0.5.0 to <0.9.0

- No other plugins, configurations, etc: just syntax highlighting

- see the additional `.vscode/settings` for better git workspace environment

- [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ContractShark.solidity-lang)
